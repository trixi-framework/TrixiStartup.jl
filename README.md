# TrixiStartup.jl

**Note: This repository is highly experimental, thus anything can change at any
time and without warning, including the existence of the repository itself.**

This is an experiment to set up a startup package for some typical
[Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl)
workloads for Julia v1.9+, with the goal of reducing the startup time for new
users.
